# Titanic - Mini Data Science Project

A brief exploratory analysis and first machine learning approach for the Titanic dataset.  
This project demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore real-world data
- Visualize important features
- Build and evaluate a simple classification model (Logistic Regression)

## Overview
The **Titanic** dataset is one of the most popular introductory datasets for data science. It contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including their survival status. The primary goal is to predict whether a passenger survived based on various features such as age, fare, and class.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)  
- **Files Used:**
  - `train.csv`: Contains passenger features (e.g., `Age`, `Fare`, `Pclass`) and the target variable `Survived`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Recommended libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `jupyter`  
- (Optional) A virtual environment or conda environment for isolated package management

### Setup
1. **Clone this repository** or download the ZIP:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-mini-project.git
2.Install required libraries (example using pip)
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
3.Launch Jupyter Notebook and open analysis.ipynb:
   jupyter notebook
4.Run the cells in Titanic.ipynb to see the data exploration, plots, and model training steps.

### Tips for a Great Impression
1. **Be Clear and Concise:** Readers should quickly understand the projectâ€™s purpose and how to run it.  
2. **Add Visuals:** If possible, include screenshots of key plots or final results in your README (you can embed images using Markdown syntax).  
3. **Keep It Updated:** Whenever you add features or change the workflow, reflect those changes in the README.  

With this structure, your repository will look professional and be easy for others to follow. Good luck with your Titanic mini-project!
